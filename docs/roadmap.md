# Calxgloss Roadmap — Methodology Tracks

> **Purpose:** index of all open tracks — status, dependencies, and what's
> next. This is the *roadmap*, not the plan of record for active work.
>
> **Where plans live:** when a track is picked up, its detailed plan is
> published to GitHub Issues (`scriptandcompile/calxgloss`) via `/to-spec` →
> `/to-tickets` (tickets carry native blocking links + triage labels), and the
> epic link is added to the status matrix below. `/implement` works the
> tickets; `CHANGELOG.md` stays the record of what shipped.
>
> **Where done tracks go:** a completed track is removed from this roadmap —
> its shipped history lives in `CHANGELOG.md` and its key decisions are
> recorded as ADRs in `docs/adr/` (W0 → ADR-0002, W1 → ADR-0003, W2 →
> ADR-0004, W3 → ADR-0005, W4 → ADR-0006, G1 → ADR-0007, X2 → ADR-0008,
> P1.5 → ADR-0009–0013, X5 → ADR-0041).

## How a track gets built

1. Pick the next unblocked track from the matrix (table order = priority).
2. `/to-spec` — synthesize the track summary here (plus its archive section)
   into a spec issue.
3. `/to-tickets` — decompose into tracer-bullet tickets with blocking edges;
   label `ready-for-agent`.
4. `/implement` — drive the tickets (tdd + code-review per ticket).
5. Update this matrix when a phase completes.

Test counts in the archive are indicative targets, not exact requirements.
